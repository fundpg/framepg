By doing so these organizations bring three benefits to the world: (1) directly contribute to funding basic incomes for people in extreme poverty, (2) spread the word about Glo Dollar to a bigger audience, indirectly growing basic income funding, and (3) opportunity to join the Glo Consortium to further collaborate on reducing extreme poverty. Glo Dollar is collaborating with Arbitrum DAO to bring a total of $10,000 in USDGLO in matching for organizations that embed philanthropy. Whether you're already part of the Glo Consortium or looking to dive into Glo, this round is for you.",

Creation of tools for native crypto communities such as:    1. Newsletter minting and 1Inch wallet integration    2. Podcast recording and publishing    3. Social posting and utilization    4. Verification tools    5. Inscriptions or Attestations with a better frontend.    6. Grants tooling    7. DAO Tooling2.. It will be necessary at all times to have open source so that whoever can access these tools can improve or perfect them.3. We consider that the Arbitrum community is great, however it is fragmented due to lack of chain communication, so having tools that allow communication and adoption will be disruptive.In the near future the grantees, can be part of the projects that made this possible and start working or making applications.
